# Didactic Projects in Python

Projects developed in order to learn the language basics, exercise coding, learn more about computer science and have fun solving some interesting problems !

What you can find in this repo:

- Unit01_longestAlphOrder

Let s be a string of lowercase characters. This program prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'abcabcegpzbaabcdefgh', then the program prints 'aabcdefgh'

- Unit02_numberGuess

You think of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes guesses, and you give it inputs: is its guess too high or too low ? Using bisection search, the computer will guess your secret number

- Unit02_iterationXrecursion

Series of exercises to present the difference, as well as advantages and disadvantages in solving problems with iteration and recursion

- Unit02_debtCalculations

Unit_2_ProblemSet_2_1_debtAfterYear: calculates the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment (4%) required by the credit card company each month

Unit_2_ProblemSet_2_2_minimumPayOff: calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment (multiple of $10) needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months

Unit_2_ProblemSet_2_3_bisectionEfficiency: uses bisection search to make the program more efficient: finds the result faster while being more precise also - accurate to the cent instead of finding a result that is multiple of $10

- Unit03_hangman

Hangman game : you have 8 guesses to find out the word that was randomly loaded from the words.txt file
