# Didactic Projects in Python

Projects developed in order to learn the language basics, exercise coding, learn more about computer science and have fun solving some interesting problems !

What you can find in this repo:

- Unit01_longestAlphOrder

Let s be a string of lowercase characters. This program prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'abcabcegpzbaabcdefgh', then the program prints 'aabcdefgh'

- Unit02_numberGuess

You think of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes guesses, and you give it inputs: is its guess too high or too low ? Using bisection search, the computer will guess your secret number

- Unit03_hangman

Hangman game : you have 8 guesses to find out the word that was randomly loaded from the words.txt file
